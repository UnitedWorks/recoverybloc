                    <li> In 72% of the cases where bail is set, it is for $1,000 or less.<sup><a href="#stat1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">1</a></sup></li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Of those cases, 87% of defendants are unable to afford bail and face an average of 16 days of pretrial detention. This may result in job loss, inability to provide child and/or elderly care, loss of treatment for mental health and other health issues, loss of place in homeless shelters, and much more.<sup><a href="#stat2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">2</a></sup></li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>In some instances, a defendant may be incarcerated for years awaiting trial.<sup><a href="#stat3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">3</a></sup></li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Based on recent reporting by the Atlantic, over 60% of people currently in jail have not yet been to trial.<sup><a href="#stat4" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">4</a></sup></li>
                </p>
                <p>Guilty pleas account for 99.6% of all convictions of New York City misdemeanor defendants. 97 percent% of federal felony convictions are the result of plea bargains.<sup><a href="#stat5" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">5</a></sup></p>
                <p>Defendants unable to pay bail are 9x more likely to take plea deals, reflected in a 90% a jump in guilty pleas from those facing pretrial detention, up from the 40% rate of guilty pleas by those who can afford bail.<sup><a href="#stat6" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">6</a></sup></p>
                <p>Defendants who are able to pay bail and stand trial have a conviction rate of roughly 50%. Defendants who are forced to serve pretrial jail time have a conviction rate of 92%.<sup><a href="#stat7" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">7</a></sup></p>
                <p>A 2012 report by the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, based on 10 years’ worth of criminal statistics concludes, ‘‘The data suggest that detention itself creates enough pressure to increase guilty pleas.’’<sup><a href="#stat8" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">8</a></sup></p>
                <p>Conversely, if a defendant is able to come up with $500 or $1,000 to make bail, their chances increase exponentially for no jail time and dismissed charges.<sup><a href="#stat9" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">9</a></sup></p>
                <p>“The open secret is that in most jurisdictions, bail is the grease that keeps the gears of the overburdened system turning. Faced with the prospect of going to jail for want of bail, many defendants accept plea deals instead, sometimes at their arraignments….If even a small fraction of those defendants asserted their right to a trial, criminal courts would be overwhelmed. By encouraging poor defendants to plead guilty, bail keeps the system afloat.” - <i>The New York Times Magazine</i><sup><a href="#stat10" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">10</a></sup></p>
                <p>The U.S. incarcerates 693 people for every 100,000 residents. 2.3 million people are in cages on any given day, giving the U.S. the distinction of having the highest incarceration rate in the world; even measured up against comparable industrialized nations.<sup><a href="#stat11" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">11</a></sup></p>
                <p>“If everyone charged with crimes suddenly exercised his constitutional rights, there would not be enough judges, lawyers or prison cells to deal with the ensuing tsunami of litigation.” – Michelle Alexander, <i>The New York Times</i><sup><a href="#stat12" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref">12</a></sup></p>
                <p>According to the 2017 Prison Policy Initiative, of the 630,000 people in jail on any given day, 70% are being held without trial.</p>
                <p>65 million Americans have criminal records according to National Employment Law Project in 2011.</p>
