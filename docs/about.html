        <h1>About Recovery Bloc</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/mythirstybrain/posts/10103532547518257" target="_blank">My friend Christine recently announced a problem her community is having</a>. In her town, where humidity reached 80%+ and electricity was absent, black mold was taking over homes. This mold leads to long term respiratory issues, so she asked for money that could help them get solar panels and dehumidfiers after trying other methods. I saw Bail Bloc around the same time, and wondered with a simple modification of the tool, if our friends and family could help her.</p>
        <br/>
        <h1>How it Works</h1>
        <p>When you download the app, a small part of your computer's unused processing power is redirected toward mining a popular cryptocurrency called <a href="https://getmonero.org/" target="_blank">Monero</a>, which is secure, private, and untraceable. At the end of every month, we exchange the Monero for US dollars and donate the earnings to community leaders rebuilding their towns and neighborhoods in Puerto Rico.</p>
        <br/>
        <h1>WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY?</h1>
        <p>Cryptocurrency isnâ€™t real money, but it has real-world exchange value.
        <p>Just as the US Treasury prints money to infuse into the economy, cryptocurrency is generated "out of nowhere" through an arbitrary process. But where the US Treasury needs a minting machine, all miners need is computing power. Cryptocurrencies are generated through users running software to solve difficult computational problems, in a process known as "mining." When a problem is solved, the user is rewarded by a decentralized cryptocurrency network with units of that cryptocurrency. If enough users mine for the same cryptocurrency, it begins to have an exchange value.</sup>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1>GOAL</h1>
        <p>With enough downloads over time, the compounding revenue generated from Recovery Bloc has the potential to help secure funding for community infrastructure needs in Puerto Rico, saving lives and preventing long term illness from issues such as black mold.</p>
