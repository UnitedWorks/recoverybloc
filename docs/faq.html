      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h3>I installed it and it's going grey/de-activating automatically</h3>
      <p>Recovery Bloc is designed to turn itself off if you are only using battery power and are below 50%. You can change this inside of Settings.</h3>
      <p>Unlike Bitcoin and other popular crypto coins, which require a great deal of energy to mine, Monero is ASIC-resistant, which means that it requires a comparatively negligible amount of energy, and is therefore cost efficient.</p>
      <h3>I don't see the $ amount raised going up</h3>
      <p>Sparing the details, the mining pool that we are a part of tends to hit Monero block rewards approximately every 48 hours. Sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less, but you should see the $ raised go up every two days or so.</p>
      <h3>How much of my CPU will this require?</h3>
      <p>By default Recovery Bloc uses 10% of your CPU, which should make it unnoticeable for most users. This setting is labeled as "Low Impact" on the Settings dropdown menu. You can also optionally increase the CPU impact to 25% (Medium) and 50% (High)</h3>
      <h3>Is there a way to compile and run this from the command line?</h3>
      <p>There is. Check out our <a href="https://github.com/unitedworks/recoverybloc" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
      <h3>How do I uninstall it?</h3>
      <p>On macOS: RecoveryBloc is running in your menu bar, at the top of your screen. Find the icon, click it, and hit Quit. Then drag the app from your Applications folder into the Recycling bin.</p>
      <p>On Windows: RecoveryBloc is running in your system tray, at the bottom right of your screen. Find the icon, right click it, and hit Quit. Then go to Add/Remove programs from the start menu as usual.</p>
